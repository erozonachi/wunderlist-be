  "description": "Wunderlist 2.0 takes your traditional to-do list app and automates it. It not only allows you to write your to-do, work, grocery, trip and household lists, but allows you to set up recurring to do lists by date and time. (Think recurring events on google calendar + to-do list app). No matter how much is on your plate, Wunderlist 2.0 makes it super easy to remember all the little recurring to-dos and surprise to-dos that pop up unexpectedly. 1. An on-boarding process for a new general user 3. Ability to easily create / setup a to do list item 4. Ability to easily edit / update / mark items as complete 5. Ability to completely delete an item 6. Ability to easily search / find items 7. Ability to schedule items and automatically repeat on a weekly or daily or monthly basis 8. Page to display their existing to-doâ€™s for the day, or for the month. Can also view items marked as completed, and deleted items (saved for seven days) Stretch: Add the ability to collaborate. Share your lists and work collaboratively on projects with your colleagues, friends and family.",
